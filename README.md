## Overview

[Your Plugin Name] is a plugin for IntelliJ IDEA that [briefly describe what your plugin does]. This document provides instructions for setting up, running, and testing the plugin in a development environment.

<!-- Plugin description -->
**IntelliJ Platform Plugin Template** is a repository that provides a pure template to make it easier to create a new plugin project (check the [Creating a repository from a template][gh:template] article).

The main goal of this template is to speed up the setup phase of plugin development for both new and experienced developers by preconfiguring the project scaffold and CI, linking to the proper documentation pages, and keeping everything organized.
